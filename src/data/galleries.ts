            Welcome to the Gallery on Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj’s Life’s Work to Spread Peace and Joy through Meditation. 
            Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj’s life’s work has been to share the meditation practices so people of all backgrounds can experience the wonders, joy, and peace that the inner Light and Sound bring.
            His own spiritual journey began in childhood when he began meditating under the guidance of his two spiritual Masters of the last century, Sant Kirpal Singh Ji Maharaj and Sant Darshan Singh Ji Maharaj. He experienced higher states of consciousness and the peace, joy, and inner wisdom it brings.  
            His training in the sciences with B.Tech degree at I.I.T. Madras and a Master’s Degrees in Electrical Engineering at I.I.T. Chicago, and a successful 20-year career in science, communication, and technology enabled him to apply the scientific method to meditation to see for himself and prove the existence of the spiritual treasures within. One of his major contributions to humanity is his ability to unite science and spirituality and make the traditions of meditation from the East accessible and easy for those in the West to understand and practice.
            Among the photos in this gallery is one showing Sant Kirpal Singh Ji Maharaj and Sant Darshan Singh Ji Maharaj seeing Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj off at the airport as he left Delhi, India, in 1968, to begin his Master’s degree program in Chicago, Illinois. 
            In 1989, Sant Darshan Singh Ji Maharaj had Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj continue their work of teaching meditation on inner Light and Sound to people around the world through his many public talks and meditation seminars. 
            In this gallery, enjoy a multi-media experience of the wonders of the spiritual journey that SOS meditation on the Light and Sound as taught by Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj brings.

Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj selflessly dedicates his life to helping people throughout the world experience the treasures of peace, happiness, and spiritual consciousness within through meditation on the inner Light and Sound.
            Since 1989, in loving service to humanity, he continuously and tirelessly crisscrosses the globe holding tour programs of public talks on meditation for inner and outer peace and happiness followed by meditation sittings.

He generously provides multiple opportunities for countless millions to meet him to deepen their spiritual progress and awaken them to the wondrous experiences awaiting within. 
            Since 1989, Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj has travelled over 2.5 million miles, holding around 850 tour stops in 43 countries on 6 continents. Throughout these tours and during time spent at the two international centers, the Science of Spirituality International Meditation Center in Lisle, Illinois, in the United States, and at the Sawan Kirpal Ruhani Mission—Science of Spirituality headquarters in Delhi, India, he has been giving an astounding number of over 20,000 talks since 1989, an incredible labor of love for one individual to accomplish in service to humanity.
            This World Tour gallery of the Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj Diamond Jubilee Exhibition features a world map of his continual world tours and a chart of the countries in which he held programs. It also shows some highlighted photos of his tour programs on different continents to give a flavor of the magnitude of his devotion to help people experience the joys and wonders of meditation.

            Welcome to The Gallery of Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj’s Selfless Service and Charitable, Humanitarian Work which highlights the depth of his universal love and caring for all people as expressed through the many humanitarian efforts he leads to aid those in need. 
            Selfless service is one of the hallmark contributions of  Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj’s life’s work. It encompasses helping more than just our own physical families; it includes all humanity. 
            At Kirpal Ashram, in Delhi, India, Science of Spirituality, under the inspiration of Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj, provides free allopathic, homeopathic, and ayurvedic clinics, free blood donations, free health checkups, and free eye camps where thousands of cataract surgeries are performed. They also provide free medical equipment including wheelchairs and crutches to those in need. To uplift the community economically, women in villages are taught how to sew so they can earn income.
            Worldwide Science of Spirituality centers also engage in social service activities such as collecting food, clothing, and supplies for those in need, toy drives for children at holidays, making PPE equipment and other aid for first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic, visiting people in senior homes, orphanages, and homeless shelters and many other services.
            With his large heart and deep compassion, Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj also responds to and provides relief to people suffering from natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, or tsunamis. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji leads the Science of Spirituality to respond with aid to people in need.
            In 2001, when a deadly earthquake devastated Gujarat leaving over half a million people homeless, Sant Rajinder Singh Ji and the Science of Spirituality rebuilt an entire village of Sarneshwar not only with homes, but by building a school, a community building and meditation hall, and a medical dispensary. 
            When the Asian Tsunami spread horrific destruction throughout the region, from India to the coast of Africa, Sant Rajinder Singh Ji, moved by the plight of the victims, encouraged the Young Adults of the Science of Spirituality to help. Within a few days, the Young Adults raised $61,000 for the Tsunami Relief Fund. Sant Rajinder Singh Ji had three schools built in areas devastated by the Tsunami. 
            He also traveled to the state of Tamil Nadu to dedicate three new public schools in an isolated area devastated by the Tsunami that Science of Spirituality donated to the government. 
            To further the highest quality of education coupled with a spiritual curriculum including daily meditation, in 1995 Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj founded and directs Darshan Education Foundation which has 23 schools in India and South America. By providing a period each day of meditation to improve concentration and focus and a spiritual curriculum to help develop positive qualities and encouraging performing service to others, its students continue to win numerous achievement awards for their academic and extracurricular success.  His vision has been internationally recognized by civic, educational, and social leaders.
            Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj’s own stellar example of serving humanity has inspired people in Science of Spirituality’s worldwide centers to help people in need in their local areas and globally.
